# Personal Website

This is my personal website for featuring my resume and cover letter, as well my projects and writing. It is written using HTML/CSS and Bulma CSS, and very minor JavaScript. It is deployed via Netlify. 

## Future Plans:
1. Build a simple CMS solution for my projects and writing pages (see ChaseMD/custom-cms)
2. Rewrite website code without a framework, using vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript
